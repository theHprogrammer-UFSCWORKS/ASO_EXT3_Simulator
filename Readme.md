*The entire structure of the work was created by Professor Martin and his monitors. The only files that were implemented in this work were: fs.cpp and auxFunction.hpp*

- To Compile: g++ *.cpp -o exe.out -g -lgtest -std=c++17 -lpthread
- To Run: ./exe.out
- To check for leaks: *valgrind --leak-check=full ./exe.out*
